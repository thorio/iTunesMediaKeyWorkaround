# iTunesMediaKeyWorkaround
For some reason media keys don't work in my iTunes installation on windows, so i created this to fix that issue.

## Installation
Download the [latest release](https://github.com/thorio/iTunesMediaKeyWorkaround/releases/latest).  
Install [AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com/) if you haven't already.  
Extract the Archive and execute the `iTunes.ahk` file.
